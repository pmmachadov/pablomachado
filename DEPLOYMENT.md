# Deployment to pablomachado.dev

This portfolio is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages at [pablomachado.dev](https://pablomachado.dev).

## Setup Complete ✅

- ✅ Next.js configured for static export
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- ✅ Custom domain CNAME file configured

## How it works

Every push to the `main` branch triggers an automatic build and deployment via GitHub Actions.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build Static Site

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an `out/` directory with the static site.
